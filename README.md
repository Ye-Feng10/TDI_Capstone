## General Description

With the increased number of people who received COVID-19 vaccination, the study of adverse symptoms becomes more important. CDC keeps updating the reports of adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, based on the reports, serious adverse events are rare, but may occur. 

On an individual level, understanding the potential outcomes and risk factors of adverse symptoms will be helpful in terms of making a decision on whether to take the vaccine (or booster) or not and taking a better medication preparation after vaccination. 

With the VAERS data, the goals of this project are:

1. use a machine learning model to predict the needs for hospitalization based on pre-vaccine information (gender, age, medication history ...) and post-vaccine information (symptoms)

2. Identify the most important symptoms for predicting needs for hospitalization
